# Koios

A lightweight data manager.

The end goals are:

- An easy and non-intrusive way to manipulate heterogeneous data sources (either read-only or read-write)
- Out of the box bindings to most widely used DBMS
- Full forward and backward compatibility to data model changes
- Remote / Distributed access with robust failover setup
- A dynamic UI that self-builds itself based on models' metadata

Basically remove all the plumbing pains when building new systems.

Work in progress!
- Currently not ready for use
- Architecture may significantly change
